# Restores lore of broken portals, if useitem is enabled and lore checks are used in item.yml

# Not recommended to enable, due to the following:
# On server stop, portals placed but not linked will not drop with lore when the server runs again
# Banners broken by physics (explosions, floor breaking due to an external cause) will not drop with lore
# When breaking one portal in a pair, the other breaks and drops as well
# More resource-intensive

# Note that if you want bannerportals to be exclusive (can only be obtained from a shop, lootcrate etc), you can simply set the name to a colored name
# However, if you still insist on using lore and having them reusable, and is alright with aformentioned limitations, go ahead and enable
